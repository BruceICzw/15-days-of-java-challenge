# MY 15 DAYS OF JAVA CHALLENGE

This repository contains the code for my personal 15 Days of Java Challenge. The challenge is designed to help me master Java programming by working on a series of hands-on projects. Each day, I will be given a new topic to learn and a task to complete. By the end of the challenge, I will have built a solid foundation in Java programming and object-oriented design, bringing me closer to my goal of becoming a Java master.

| 6   | Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics | Define a class representing a car with attributes like make, model, and year, along with methods to get and set these attributes.                                                                                                    |

| 12  | File Handling                            | Develop a program to read data from a text file, perform some operation on it, and write the result to another file.                                                                                                                 |

| 14  | Generics                                 | Create a generic class called "Box" to store objects of any type, along with methods to add, remove, and get items from the box.                                                                                                     |
| 15  | Review and Project                       | Build a simple library management system using classes like "Book", "Library", and "Member", implementing features like borrowing and returning books.                                                                               |
